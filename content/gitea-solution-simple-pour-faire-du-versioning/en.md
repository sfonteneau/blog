A quick post to introduce a tool I’ve been discovering lately: **Gitea**.

What is Gitea? A no‑nonsense, self‑hosted Git service.

Why not GitLab? Sure, GitLab is more complete:

But Gitea has a **big** advantage: very low CPU and RAM usage.

I also find Gitea more responsive. A very efficient tool if you need to version code and documentation.

PS: for Windows users, Gitea runs on Windows too!
