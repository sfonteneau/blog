While on vacation, here’s a non‑IT post.

Not long ago I changed car. Unfortunately: no Bluetooth, no AUX input, no USB, no SD card… only FM radio and CDs (with good sound quality, to be fair).

I first looked at replacing the head unit, but it was complicated (on‑board computer wiring, etc.), and it would also have ruined the design. So I tested a few alternatives — here’s my feedback.

## 1) Belkin CarAudio Connect (FM)

The idea is:

Phone → Belkin CarAudio Connect (FM) → car radio receives it on an FM frequency

It works… but it’s FM quality (not great), and if you drive a lot, the frequency you picked may no longer be free. I dropped this option.

If your car radio has an AUX input, there’s another solution:

**Belkin CarAudio Connect (AUX / Bluetooth)**

Same idea, but via AUX, so there are no frequency issues and the sound quality is much better. Cheap and great… except my head unit has no AUX.

So I tried something else.

## 2) Parrot kit

Parrot kits are nice: they can mute *all* audio during calls (unlike the two Belkin options), for example they cut the radio to ring your phone.

How does it work? The Parrot kit basically takes over the head unit electronically and includes its own amplifier.

Downsides:
- Without extra adapters you often lose steering wheel controls (even volume).
- Because it uses its own amplifier, sound quality and/or power can be affected.

## 3) YATOUR (CD-changer port)

The YATOUR is clever, but not compatible with every car.

It uses the CD‑changer connector on the back of the head unit (kind of like an AUX input).

This box provides AUX, SD card and USB, plus optional iPod and Bluetooth.

A small annoyance: steering wheel controls (next/volume) work, but with Bluetooth the “next track” button didn’t work for me — I may have the wrong Bluetooth module. There’s also a small “answer” button to install. I hid everything in the glove box.

Compared to Parrot, one downside is that you must switch to the “CD” source when you receive a call. The other big downside is compatibility: your head unit must support the YATOUR model.

**Up to you to choose!**
