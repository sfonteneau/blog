I’m currently a network administrator in a middle school and a high school. I’m passionate about IT and networking in general, and I care a lot about using free/open‑source solutions both at work and at home.

This humble website is both a presentation and a notebook: I post things here whenever I feel like it.

PS: this post is shamelessly copied from the default WordPress “Hello world” idea 😉
