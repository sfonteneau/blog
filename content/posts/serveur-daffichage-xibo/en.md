A quick post about another solution we use: **Xibo**.

What is Xibo?

Xibo is a client/server digital signage system.

In my school we use it with 6 display screens (NUC DE3815TYKE) running the Xibo client, and a web server hosting Xibo server and the media to display.

The advantage of a web interface (instead of a local “thick” app) is that multi‑site setups become easy. And even if you’re on the other side of the world, you can still manage your signage remotely.

Xibo is flexible and supports scheduling and recurring campaigns (it can be a bit confusing at first though).

My main criticism is that layout creation is not always intuitive.
